#Approach 1:
This is the brute force approach. In this approach we iterate through two for loops, through which we take the
first element and the compare with every other element.

#Apprach 2:
In the second approach we use dictionary, where we store every element with it's index, and then calculate the complement by
subtracting the number from target. Then we check if this subtraction is in our original dictionary.
