Step 1: The goal here is to identify the element which is equal to zero in the flowerbed list.
Step 2: Then we check if the left and right element of this index position are equal to zero.
Step 3: If the condition is true we assign 1 to the current index position.
Step 4: As we do that we increase the count of a counter.
Step 5: We finally check (or stop the process) when the count is greater than the number of plants 'n' that are to be planted.
Step 6: Return true or false after the result of condition.

**Time Complexity**
Since in the code, we only go through effectively one for loop to iterate through list, that is why the time complexity is O(N).
**Space Complexity**
It takes up a constant space since the size of variables we are using does not vary with input, hence space complexity is O(1).
